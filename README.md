# Dusk
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Description: A Final Project of Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. Dusk is a web application that is keeps track of the a task. It is developed with students and developers in mind. Dusk also helps the user concentrate whilst at this task. The inspiration was drawn from my lack of concentration - I have ADHD, which is very bad for someone that wants to spend hours coding. Dusk focuses on solving a problem that has already been solved but in a better way. For instance, most browsers time keepers will keep ticking when my laptop lid is shut. It's supposed to stop since the user isn't working at the moment.

#### Main Description
  Dusk is a web application built with javascript and python (flask) that keeps track of a task using the pomodoro technique. Pomodoro technique according to [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management method developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
