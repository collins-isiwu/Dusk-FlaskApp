# Dusk
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Description: A Final Project of Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. Dusk is a web application that is keeps track of the a task. It is developed with students and developers in mind. Dusk also helps the user concentrate whilst at this task. The inspiration was drawn from my lack of concentration - I have ADHD, which is very bad for someone that wants to spend hours coding. Dusk focuses on solving a problem that has already been solved but in a better way. For instance, most browsers time keepers will keep ticking when my laptop lid is shut. It's supposed to keep stop since the user isn't working at the moment.
